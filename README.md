## Requirements

### Python Scripts

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
-   All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
-   All your classes should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
-   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
-   A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)


### Python Unit Tests

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
-   You have to use the [unittest module](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/5BK144LlyD8OKE1QdRdSBw "unittest module")
-   All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
-   All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
-   Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
-   All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
-   You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
-   We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
